                  <p>Silent Valley National Park, Palakkad Overview
                    The Silent Valley National Park, with its lush green forests and beautiful views of the rich flora and fauna, is a popular destination for nature as well as wildlife lovers all across the globe. Spread across an area of 89 square kilometres, the Silent Valley National Park is located in the Kundali Hills of the Western Ghats in Kerala in southern India. With its long, detailed history and the unique status of a rainforest, this national park is indeed a sight to visit. The well-planned Safari and the beautiful stop-overs around the park only make a trip to this part of Kerala more worthwhile.
                    
                    A visit to this national park holds prominent significance for traveller and nature enthusiasts as this site is the last representative virgin tract of tropical evergreen forests in India. Though smaller in size when compared to the other national parks in India, what set the Silent Valley National Park apart from all other similar sites is the Sylvan environment that the region boasts of, along with its lofty and majestic peaks and the several rivers that run through its length.
                    
                    The numerous plant and animal species that can be found here are indeed worth mentioning. The park has a strong faunal and floral population, with many of the endangered species residing here blissfully, unharmed by the outer environment. The ones who are most commonly seen here are the elephant, tiger, lion-tailed macaque, gaur, wild pig, panther and sambar. The vegetation of this park is the tropical, moist evergreen kind. It is also almost next to possible to ignore the presence of the River Kunthi, which descends from the Nilgiri Hills and then passes through this region, enchanting visitors with its crystal clear water, devoid of any impurities.</p>

                    <p>Palakkad Fort, Palakkad Overview
                      The Palakkad Fort in Kerala is a beautiful historical monument that has gently integrated its high walls with its surrounding green gardens. One of the most well-preserved forts in the state of Kerala, the Palakkad fort was built in the 1766 AD by Hyder Ali and is now a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India.
                      
                      This picturesque fort is located in the heart of Palakkad town at the foothills of the Sahyadris range in a labyrinth of dense forests and crisscrossing cascading rivers. The mighty fort is spread over an area of 60,702 square meters and is immensely famous for its architecture, which displays the efficiency of the French craftsman. The magnificent fortress of Pallakad is an essential part of history, and its construction is majestic as well
                      
                      The fort is in the shape of a square and is supported by walls and bastions which are square shaped as well. Earlier, the entrance to the fort was via a drawbridge, which has now been replaced by a permanent one in its place. A significant ground is also present within the premises of the fort, which served as stable for the horses and elephants of Tipu Sultan's army in ancient times. It is placed between the fort and the Palakkad Town Hall and is known as the Kota Maidanam. It is currently used as the venue for cricket matches, exhibitions and public gatherings. There is an open-air auditorium here as well, which is known as Rappadi.
                      
                      The Palakkad fort also houses some other smaller attractions such as the Hanuman temple, Martyr's column, Anjaneya Swami Temple (a small shrine), Vatika Shilavatika (a garden) and a sub-jail. Amalgamating the beauty of lush green gardens and impressive ancient architecture, this fort is a truly humbling experience. The fort is also known as the Tipuâ€™s Fort, after the name of Tipu Sultan (son of Hyder Ali). The majestic fort depicts the old tales of bravery and courage.</p>

                        It is the largest reservoir in Kerala and is served by a network of two canal systems. Its construction was initiated in 1949, and it took about six years to finish the project. The foundation stone of the project was laid on 27 March 1949 by the then Public Works Minister, Sri. M. Bhaktavatsalam. During the time of its initiation, Palakkad was a part of Madras presidency. The dam was inaugurated on 9 October 1955 by the then Chief Minister of Madras, Sri. K. Kamaraj. Malampuzha Dam has a total catchment area of 145 square kilometers, and the reservoir has a capacity of 8000 square meters of water. The repository provides drinking water in the nearby areas while the canal system helps in irrigation.
