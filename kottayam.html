                  Clay Art Cafe is a quaint art gallery cum cafetaria situated on the K. K. Road in Kottayam. The building has been made of mud and old style bamboo thatch roofing.

                <p>Elaveezha Poonchira, Kottayam Overview
                    Located at a distance of 15 kms from Thodupuzha and 60 kms from Kottayam, Elaveezha Poonchira is a small quaint hill station. Perched at a height of 3200 feet above the sea level, it can be reached by a jeep ride through the unpaved rocky mountainous terrain. Literally translating to a ‘flowery lake where no leaves fall’, the place has acres of barren land without any plantation or trees with a perennial lake ‘Poonchira’. The area receives heavy rainfall, and the entire valley turns into a river during monsoons.
                    
                    A well kept secret of Kerala, Elaveezha Poonchira is replete with rocky cliffs, contours and crevices and hence, lures a lot of trekkers, mountaineers and adventure enthusiasts to the spot to try their hand at trekking. You can either embark on the tried and tested terrains or pave new trails for yourself. The mountain peak also offers an enthralling view of the Malankara Dam in addition to providing several captivating vistas of the surrounding paradise. Besides, it has traces of burial chambers, tribal settlements and several caves including Nilavara, Pandavan Guha etc., which are a personal favourite among the tourists.</p>

                  <p>Illikkal Kallu, Kottayam Overview
                      Located at a height of 6000 ft above the sea level in the Western Ghats of Kottayam, Kerala, Illikkal Kallu is a major tourist attraction and one of the most pristine spots in all of India. Situated in Moonnilavu Village, Meenachil taluk, the nearest city to the summit is Teekoy. Besides several other factors which make this peak unique, the most prominent feature is that half the boulder of the majestic rock has fallen apart. The remaining half stands sturdy and presents an extremely exalted picture. Surrounded by colossal green hills, the offbeat destination boasts of immaculate environs, enchanting panoramic vistas and an all around utopian atmosphere. In addition to the surreal natural beauty, the sublime view of the Arabian Sea in the near horizon as a thin blue stroke, is a sight beyond description.
                      
                      One of the highest peaks in the vicinity, Illikkal Kallu comprises of three different hills- each rising to at least 4000 ft above the sea level. Boasting of mystical surroundings, hills imbued with a green blanket and an overall idyllic setting, the destination is blessed with bounteous natural bliss and is still unexploited and untapped by tourism. Above all, the sunset view as seen from the peak is absolutely riveting; the moon rises adjacently as the orange sun goes down. Also, the winding roads leading to the majestic boulders can give an adrenaline rush to all the adventure junkies.</p>

                          Located at a distance of few kms from Erattupetta in Kottayam inside a private rubber estate, Marmala Waterfalls are popularly known as the ‘enchantress of the jungle’. Plummeting from a height of 200 feet, the unblemished clear waters create an aura of mist around them. The tantalising waterfalls splash into a 12 feet pond and run down to join the river Teekoy. Replete with timber trees on the green-carpeted mountains, the clear cascading waters offer a sight like no other. Slightly veiled amidst thick bushes and blue hills, the location can only be reached by a short trek on the hillside.</p>
