                      The Munroe Island, also known as Mundrothuruthu, is a picturesque and magnificent inland island that is located at the confluence of the Kallada River and the Ashtamudi Lake, in the district of Kollam. Named in honour of its resident, Colonel John Munro who belonged to the former princely state of Travancore and during his stay here integrated several backwater regions by digging canals, the island is renowned for its splendid beauty and scenic views and adds to the sheer beauty and charm of the already intriguing God's own country. This hidden treasure comprises of 8 islands in total, all of which are separated by small water channels and lakes.</p>

                      <p>Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam Overview
                        The second largest lake in Kerala, Ashtamudi Lake is situated in the Kollam district. The lake runs over a length of 16 kilometres and covers almost 30% of the town of Kollam. Its name, Ashtamudi has been derived from two words 'Ashta' meaning eight and 'Mudi' meaning branch, thereby stating the fact that lake has eight branches. All the eight branches converge into a single channel that meets with the Arabian Sea. The lake is fed by the major river, Kallada. Coconut trees and palms surround the entire vicinity of the lake adding to its beauty.</p>

                        <p>Shenduruny Wildlife Sanctuary, Kollam Overview
                          Located in the Western Ghats in the Kollam district of Kerala, the Shenduruny Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area that serves as the natural habitat for a myriad of plants, birds and animals, and provides them with a safe reclusive spot, far away from the dust and dirt of city life. The sanctuary was established on 25 August in 1984 and is presently under the control of the Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve. This majestic site is like a treasure trove for all nature lovers, photographers, archaeologists and biologists since the place is home to endless flowering plants, birds and trees. The vast floral and faunal variety that is found here is what attracts tourists from all across the country, and lures them to come and spend a day in silence and tranquillity.
                          
                          Spread over an area of 172 square kilometres, the sanctuary also boasts of being home to an artificial lake that is around 18 square kilometres in size and is surrounded by the reservoir of the Thenmala Dam. According to specific archaeological studies that were recently conducted here, the wildlife sanctuary has been home to some of the oldest and earliest river valley civilisations of the country, some of which were even older than the Indus Valley civilisation. These findings have now also added an archaeological aspect to the site, and the popularity of the sanctuary has now doubled. Interestingly, the first eco-tourism project in India, known as the Thenmala Eco-tourism Project, was also formulated in and around the Shenduruney Wildlife Sanctuary.</p>
