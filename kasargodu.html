                  Built-in the 17th century by Sivappa Nayak of Bedanore, the Chandragiri fort lies in the Kasaragod District of north Kerala, the southern state of India.

                  The Chandragiri Boat Club nearby offers boat trips to the nearby islands and palm groves, and on some of the islands you can get down and camp. The local fishermen will accompany you in the boat rides, so you will get to know the unabridged stories of the locales, and any compelling story, legend or folklore about the fort, if there is any. Full of artistic and historical significance, this place is visited by locals as well as tourists for the breathtaking view of the estuarine that Payaswini river forms with the Arabian Sea.</p>
