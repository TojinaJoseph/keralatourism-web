                <p>Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Kannur Overview
                  Being the northernmost wildlife reserve in the whole of Kerala and the only wildlife sanctuary in Kannur, the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is quite a big deal. Amidst these sky-touching trees and mesmerising greenery, many exotic wildlife species have marked their territory. Taking a safari through the thick verdure and venturing deeper into the forests, you will encounter many striking and remarkably extraordinary species of animals as well as birds that will leave you stumped and in awe of nature's wondrous creations.
                  
                  There are nature camps organised at the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary that attempt to acquaint the people, especially students, to the wildlife and give them a chance to take a much-needed break from the city's blaring noise. The sanctuary also has a few trekking locations that have attracted the attention of many tourists for the past few years. The landscape of the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is an interesting one that ranges between a depth of only 50 metres above sea level to an altitude of 1145 metres in the skies at Katti Betta, its highest peak. Dotted with towering trees and dense foliage, this sanctuary is adorned with a beautiful mix of a diverse forestation- evergreen, semi-evergreen and moist deciduous. </p>

                  <p>Cherupuzha, Kannur Overview
                    A hill station in Kannur, Kerala, Cherupuzha is a part of the Western Ghat mountain ranges in India. Because of the hillside location, this town is surrounded by nature and has dense forests towards the eastern side that borders the state of Karnataka. This is one of the many reasons tourists flock to this land to seek the remoteness and tranquility of nature.
                    
                    Cherupuzha is well-connected to most of the famous cities such as Bangalore (326 km), Mangalore (121 km), Thiruvananthapuram (524 km), Ernakulam (332 km), and Kozhikode (150 km). Also, Cherupuzha is easily reachable via the east district of Kannur and Payannur. Cherupuzha and its neighboring towns were once ruled by royal lineages, such as the Kingdom of Mysore’s Tipu Sultan, Kolathunadu’s Chirakkal dynasty, and Ezhimala’s Mooshika dynasty. Later, it was taken over by the British Raj. Today, there are many attractions and activities that tourists can indulge in during their visit to Cherupuzha.</p>

                    <p>Kannur Lighthouse, Kannur Overview
                      Being Kerala's first lighthouse ever and Kannur's only one, the Kannur Lighthouse is a pretty big deal. Standing tall at the height of 75 feet, this lighthouse was first built in the early months of 1903. This cylindrical concrete tower has managed to withstand the attacks of the Arabian Sea and has been fully functional for over a century. The Kannur Lighthouse has a balcony with a light that is lit as the evening breaks in to alert the seamen of the land. Treat the history buff in you and visit this site to be impressed by its fascinating history, fall in love with its mesmerising backdrop and be delighted by the impeccable view.
                      
                      Since the lighthouse stands at a considerable height, one is delighted with an enchanting and panoramic view of the entire city of Kannur, the limitless Arabian Sea, the Baby Beach and even parts of Payyaballam Beach. Going up the spiral staircase of this lighthouse, you are introduced to a variety of ancient navigational equipment whose immaculate engineering and impeccable designs are sure to impress you greatly. You can take a stroll along the perfectly maintained lawns of the lighthouse or enjoy a joyful musical fountain show in the evenings! If you want to dig deeper into the fascinating lighthouse history, there is a small auditorium that plays documentaries about the specifics of lighthouse revolution for the curious and inquisitive minds.</p>

                      <p>Mappila Bay, Kannur Overview
                        Mappila Bay, or Mopila Bay, is a natural harbour located in the city of Kannur in Kerala. In its past, the Mappila Bay served as a major port, connecting the Malabar to lands far and wide. The Bay is surrounded by some colonial-era architecture, in the magnificent Fort St. Angelo, built by the Portuguese in the 15th century. There's also the Arrakulam Palace and Museum on the other side of the harbour, dedicated to the Arakulam kingdom that ruled the Cannanore city-state in the 1500s.
                        
                        The Mappila Bay serves more like a fishing harbour than an exciting tourist destination. There are boating facilities that will take you around the harbour. However, it is advisable to stay only in the inland waters and avoid the coastal waters, that can turn unfavourable as the weather changes.</p>

                        <p>St Angelo Fort, Kannur Overview
                          St Angelos Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, St Angelos Fort enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a natural harbour.
                          
                          St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell. This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well as the international origin and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida had imprisoned his successor, Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched in the history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever. Walking around the walls of this majestic fort, you can almost picture the battles that this fortress has seen. There are tombstones of the soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the fort, barracks and an old chapel here that you can explore. Kannur's first ever lighthouse also stands next to the fort and adds to its already hypnotic glory.</p>
