                <p>Fort Kochi, Kochi Overview
                  Fort Kochi is a seaside town in the south-western part of Main Kochi which is known for its old-world colonial charm. The place still holds on to every single cultural change it has gone through over the centuries. We can see remnants of British rule all over the country. But tourists flock hear all around the year to have a glimpse of how Portuguese or Dutch colonialism affected parts of our country. The quaint city is dotted with similar structures and has an overall ambience that keeps reminding you of the colonial powers that once ruled over the place.
                  
                  The fort region of Kochi has seen the rise and fall of some European powers, mainly the Portuguese and the Chinese before that and the Dutch after, before it went under the nation-wide British rule in the 18th century. Fort Kochi is dotted with European structures, churches and other architectural buildings which take you right back to a different era back in time. 
                  
                  It has that effect on the travellers, where they get absorbed by the serene surroundings and unique architectures. Unlike most forts of middle and northern India, Fort Kochi is not about historical fortifications, canons and ruins of old palatial buildings. Till date, it has the vibe of an ancient colonial city with its toy-town like streets, colourful and charming buildings and a picturesque view out at the beach - much like the small towns of southern Europe.</p>

                        <p>Jewish Synagogue, Kochi Overview
                          Also known as Paradesi Synagogue or Mattancherry Synagogue, Cochin Jewish Synagogue is the oldest active synagogue, not just in Kochi but in the Commonwealth of Nations. Located in the Jew Town area of Kochi, the synagogue was constructed in 1567 and is one of the seven synagogues of the Malabar Yehudan or Yehudan Mappila.
                          
                          The synagogue shares its walls with the Mattancherry Palace and was built by Spanish- speaking Jews; therefore, it is also known as ‘Paradesi’ meaning ‘foreigners’. Boasting of rare antiques including beautiful chandeliers, clock tower, brass railed pulpit, Chinese hand-painted tiles etc. and striking architecture, the synagogue has four buildings of its own. In 1662, the synagogue was ruined by the Portuguese but was later renovated by the Dutch after 2 years.</p>
