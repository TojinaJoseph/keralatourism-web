                <p>Eravikulam National Park, Munnar Overview
                  Located a 45 - minute drive away from Munnar, the Eravikulam National Park (also known as Rajamalai Wildlife Sanctuary), houses a rich and diverse variety of flora and fauna and is a UNESCO world heritage site. Elephant, Nilgiri langur, Nilgiri marten, Atlas moth (largest in the world), lion-tailed macaque, small-clawed otter, and a rare tiger or leopard are some of the main animal species that can be spotted here.
                  
                  Eravikulam National Park was managed as a game reserve by the Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company before 1971. The control was taken over by the Karnataka Government in 1971, and it was declared a national park in 1978.</p>

                    Often called the pride of Kerala, Anamudi or Anai Mudi Peak in Munnar stands at a magnificent height of 2695 metres above sea level. Literally meaning “Elephants forehead,” the peak is well known to be the home for the largest surviving population of Asian elephants in India. The peak itself is within the boundaries of the Eravikulam National Park, offering plenty of opportunities to explore to flora and fauna of the surroundings.
                    
                    A famous trekking destination in Munnar, the Anamudi peak is considered to be the tallest peak outside of the Himalayas and in the Western Ghats of the South as well as the greatest topographic isolation in India. It is also famous for the Neela Kurinji flower which is known to blossom only once every 12 years.

                    <p>Meesapulimala, Idukki Overview
                      The second highest peak in Southern India, Meesapulimala stands elevated at an altitude of 2641 meters (8660 feet ) above sea level. The densely covered terrain has eight peaks that together resemble a moustache and is, therefore, called Meesapulimala. Also, considered as a hotspot of diversity, Meesapulimala has been recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site.</p>

                      <p>Idukki Arch Dam, Idukki Overview
                        Idukki Arch Dam, an engineering marvel, is located in the South-Indian state of Kerala. It is an arch dam with a double curvature and is built on River Periyar. Precisely, the dam is constructed in a gorge between two hills, Kuravathi and Kuravan. It is at the height of about 550 feet and is a breathtaking sight in the otherwise rugged terrain along which has been built.
                        
                        With this height, it is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. Because of its massive size, the dam can be seen from quite some distance and the sight of the structure in between the granite hills is breathtaking. The surrounding is lush green, and the reservoir serves as a quick getaway for locals. As part of promoting hydel tourism, boating in the reservoir is open for tourists.</p>

                        <p>Cheeyappara Waterfalls, Munnar Overview
                          Located on the Kochi-Madurai Highway (National Highway 49), the Cheeyarappa Falls is an on-the-way tourist attraction. It falls between Munnar and Kochi, in the district of Idukki, Kerala. One of the largest waterfalls in the state (which is also known as God's own country), the Cheyyappara Falls are a sight to behold.
                          
                          Cascading through seven tiers of stones, these falls are a force of nature that you can not only see and experience but dip your toes into and enjoy. The surroundings of the waterfall complement its opulent natural splendour. Evergreen forests stretch out for as much as two acres around the falls, making it an active adventure and trekking spot. Several species of exotic plants and animals can be found in the neighbouring area, enclosed in the casket of a dense forest.</p>
